							<h2 style="text-align: center;font-size: 30px;">About Me</h2>
							<p>My interest in Robotics began with my involvement in school projects when I successfully built a beetle-bot with a battery, two motors, a few magnets and pieces of guitar strings. I was thrilled when this miniature device was able to avoid, rather, change course when any obstacle was encountered. I  was thrilled but not satisfied. I needed something that could overcome challenges, not retreat and find another way out. Overcoming challenges did not mean that it should be difficult. Sometimes, the simplest solution is the best solution. This theory was validated when I experienced ‘Karakuri Kaizen’ being used to solve seemingly complex issues during my internship.
							</p>
							<p>My undergraduate project further underlined this thinking, when I developed a simple mechanism that could be used in complex procedures in systems analogous to a Robot wrist and also in remote sensing applications like Tele-surgery or offsite control of gimbal mounted cameras.</p>

							<p>I began to further explore this deeply absorbing theme and I found myself intrigued by a concept that went hand in hand, Artificial Intelligence. I was fascinated by the concept of mimicking the workings of the brain through math in machines and worked extensively in projects that combined the two. Consequently, I realized that I increasingly became more analytical in observing daily phenomenon where I constantly tried to model the mundane in math. I felt that this unique approach enabled me as I worked my way through college and my first job as a product development engineer. 
							</p>

							<p>Corporate life taught me an important lesson; customers are just as important as the technology we make for them. I found value in relating my research concepts to solving relevant problems in society and this gave me a new found sense of satisfaction. I took advantage of the flexibility and adaptability of innovative business models and tried to implement them in a variety of applications spanning from Agriculture to Healthcare.</p>

							<p>As a graduate student in the Robotic Systems Development program at Carnegie Mellon, I was able to explore and deep dive into concepts of computer vision, planning and controls and understand from the bottom up what it really takes to build a robot. My interest then led me down the computer vision route where I was able to learn through rigorous projects, the complexity and diverse applicability of cameras to the benefit of the modern world.
							
							<p>I believe that these academic and corporate experiences now enable me to blend Robotics and Entrepreneurship in order to be equipped to take on future endeavours aimed at human benefit by personalizing technology for people.</p>
